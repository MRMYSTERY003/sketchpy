## Description

This is the beginning level python project to do some awesome drawing animation using the `turtle` module, hope it grows in the future

### Usage

- Just install the package `pip install sketchpy`
- Import it to you project `import sketchpy` and use as you wantüòä

### Built with

- Turtle 
- Open-cv
- Pillow
- Svgpathtools

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python

    pip install sketchpy
```
it should probably work, If not then try the following code
    
```
    pip install turtle open-cv wheel sketchpy
```


### Example

```
    from sketchpy import library as lib
    

    obj = lib.rdj()
    obj.draw()
```

### OUTPUT
<div align = "center">

</div>

    
### More examples

```
    from sketchpy import library as lib
    
    obj = lib.bts()
    obj.draw()
```

```
    from sketchpy import library as lib

    obj = lib.vijay()
    obj.draw()
```

# Drawing from `SVG` file
    
Use the following code to draw a file from svg file, insted of tracing full image
    
#### NOTE: use this specific website to convert image to svg, sketchpy is specifically made to work with this [website](https://svgconvert.com/#/) only
    
```
    from sketchpy import canvas
    obj = canvas.sketch_from_svg('FILE PATH')
    obj.draw()
```
    
# `Saving` a loaded svg file

Insted of waiting for the svg file to load, you can save as .npy file and use that for future use
    
```
    from sketchpy import canvas
    obj = canvas.sketch_from_svg('FILE PATH')
    obj.load_svg(filename = 'data.npy')
```

## Drawing form `.npy` file

use the following code to draw your image from saved data file
    
```
    from sketchpy import canvas
    obj = canvas.sketch_from_svg('FILE PATH')
    obj.draw(filename = 'data.npy')
``` 
    
## Drawing from `raw image`
    
use the following code to draw any image, it need not to be an svg file
```
    from sketchpy import canvas
    obj = canvas.sketch_from_image('IMAGE PATH')
    obj = draw(threshold = 127)
```
#### NOTE: you can change the value of threshold to draw more detailed image, it's range is 0 - 255,use values between 90-190
